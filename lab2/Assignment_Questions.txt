1. os_maxtaskrun
2. An array of active tasks indexed by TID. It contains P_TCB structs that hold the specific task information 
3. os_idle_TCB
4. Yes
5. n-1
6a. It points to the next TCB that should be run after completion
6b. tsk_stack is the pointer to the top of the stack when the task was most recently run. stack points at the base of the memory stack
6c. No. Since OS_XCB has 8 bit its before p_lnk, and OS_TCB has 32 bits before p_lnk, the p_lnk variable will not be kept when casting OS_XCB to OS_TCB
7. mp_tcb is a block of memory for the TCBs. mp_stk is the block of memory allocated for the system stack.
8a. The program status register and the program counter are saved to the stack.
8b. bits 0-15 of os_stackinfo
8c. The stack pointer in the OS_TCB struct
8d. Using the tsk_stack pointer in the OS_TCB struct
8e. Using rt_get_PSP()
