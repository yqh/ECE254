The run_pc.sh script generates fifteen .dat files. 
Each .dat file contains timing data generated by 500 trials of the "produce" executable for a given (N,B,P,C) value. 
Assuming you follow the timing data output format as specified in the run_pc.sh file 
(see sample_output.txt for an example output format at stdout from your producer), 
then the first column is the system execution time. 

The run_pc.sh then generate the average time and standard deviation of average time tables from the .dat files. 
The two tables generated are:
tb1_$$.txt, which contains the average system execution time;
tb2_$$.txt, which contains the standard deviation of the system execution time;
where $$ is the PID of the process that executes the run_pc.sh script.

To generate histograms of the timing data, you can either use matlab or excel or any other data analysis tools you are familiar with.

1. To use matlab

  a. You need X-window support in order to see the GUI version of 
     Matlab on ecelinux. Use Xming or Cygwin-X
  b. type "matlab" on ecelinux to start a matlab session.
  c. type "M=dlmread('output.dat', ' ');" to load the data to variable M
  d. type "hist(M(:,1), 20);" to generate a histogram of the first column in M 
     with bin number of 20. Note you need to choose your own bin number. 
     Here 20 is just an example bin number
  e. type "hist(M(:,2), 20);" to generate a histogram of the second column in M
     with bin number of 20. Note you need to choose your own bin number. 
     Here 20 is just an example bin number
  f. type "help hist" for help file of matlab hist command
     type "help dlmread" for help file of matlab dlmread command

  g. check out the help file for "mean", "std", "max", and "min"


2. To use excel

  a. load your data to the excel spreadsheet
  b. read the excel help file on histogram
  c. you need to define the bin range
